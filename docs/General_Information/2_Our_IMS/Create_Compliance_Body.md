# Our IMS - Compliance

## Creating a Compliance Body

Compliance bodies do not have access to all the functions of the iMS System. Please view the [User Information and Accessibility][Info] for more information on what permissions they have, can be given, and cannot be given.

### Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Our IMS` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

After clicking the `Our IMS` button, you must now select the `Compliance` tab.

You should now see a form with 3 fields, `Certification Body`, `Standard` and `Responsibility`. After filling in these 3 fields, click on `Confirm` to create your Compliance Body.
