# Our IMS - Incident Resolution

## Setting Resolution Times

To make any changes to your incident resolution times, you must first click on `Our IMS` from the `Sidebar` on the left hand side.

Next, click on the `Incident Resolution` tab to find the form that allows you to make adjustments to the recommended incident resolution times.

From here, you can adjust the number of hours of each incident priority.

| Priority 				| Example 																			|
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Priority 1 Escalation | Major System defects and crash. Resolution in 6 hours. 							|
| Priority 2 Escalation | Issues with Logging into accounts. Resolution in 9 hours. 						|
| Priority 3 Escalation | Document issues, help with navigation and use of System. Resolution in 48 hours.	|
| Priority 4 Escalation | Technical queries and advice. Resolution in 72 hours.								|

The incident resolution time affects the relevant graphs on the Dashboard, as the Dashboard will reflect incidents being handled on time.
