# Audits - Creating an Audit

## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Audits` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

For more information on making modifications or amendments to your Audits click [here][Audits].

### Categories

After clicking the `Audits` button, you must now select which category of Audits you are create or view the schedule/history of.

The following categories are available.
+ Internal - These are Audits performed in-house
+ External - These are Audits performed by Compliance Bodies

*Note that internal Audits still require you to create a Compliance Body through which the Audits will be done, more information about creating Compliance Bodies can be found [here][Compliance Body]*

### Internal Audit

For **Internal** audits, you must first choose a `Title` for the Internal Audit. Then pick the `Business Function` that will be audited. Next you must choose the `Compliance Body` that will be performing the Audit. 

*The business function and compliance body selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the business functions and compliance bodies your organisation has created.*

From here, you select the `Auditor` and assign a `Time` and `Date` the Audit will take place. 

After selecting the `Interval` of the audit, click `confirm` to submit the Audit to the **Schedule**.
The selection of `Interval` will dictate how many Audits of this type will be added to the Schedule.
