# Dashboard

## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Dashboard` button at the top of the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

The Dashboard is also the first screen you see upon logging in to your iMS account.

### Graphs

The information shown in the Dashboard changes depending on the level of permission granted to a specific user. For instance, a Superadmin will have access to the information of the entire organisation and will see under `Business Function` the number of business functions that are created within the organisation. On the other hand, a Head of Service user will only see the name of the business function they are in charge of in the same place.

### Dashboard Report
