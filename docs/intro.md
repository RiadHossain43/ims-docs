Let's configure **iMS in less than 15 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating your organisation** with appropriate amount of licenses which will  be a onboarding process.

**Strat your iMS immediately** with **[imssystems.tech](https://imssystems.tech)**.

## Create a business function

After having a super admin access, login to the system and navigate to **Our iMS** from the `Sidebar` that you'll see at the left side of the screen.

You will find 5 tabs in the screen stay click on `Business functions` and create your business function with the information that are asked for. Great you have successfully created your first business function. 

## Add job roles to the team

Now click on `Our iMS` tab, you'll see all your business functions listed in the left pane. Click on the pencil icon and your will now be able to see your buisness function details. From the `Job roles` tab you add users by providing the required informations. List your users and your team is ready to fly to transform digitally. 

## Granting access to users

Now try to click on the key icon of a user from users pane. 

> What ? nooo !!! Not enough license ? But I paid for them in the onboarding process !!

Don't worry you have your licenses, you'll need to distribute your licenses across the board.

## License management 

Now go to the sidebar again, scroll down, click on the **User access** from there click **License management**. You'll find your business functions there that you created, currently we have only one. You also have a table of allocated licenses there, now assign the appropriate amoount of `HOS` or `BASIC`licenses to the business function and get to your `Job roles` tab again from the **Our iMS** in the sidebar.

## Access granted

Now do the same process that is click on the `key` icon of a user and system will grant them access and also will send them a welcome email with the credentials.

Credentials will look like this :

Email : your.name@domain.com

Password : `system generated string` ie: (jahd8234bj^&%d)

Give permissions to users on their merit and your team is kicked off to start using the system.
