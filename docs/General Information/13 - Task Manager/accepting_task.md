# Accepting a Task

When you are assigned a task through the Task Manager, you receive the task in your `Requests` tab.

From here you need to click on the green tick under the **Actions** tab, the popup should ask you to confirm accepting the task and upon confirming it will be moved to the tab “My Tasks”

In this tab you can access the details and, when finished, mark the task as complete.
