# Incident Management - Raise Incident

## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Incident Management` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

Once you have selected this you will be able to raise an incident.

For more information on making amendments or modifications to your Incidents click [here][Incidents].

## Raising an Incident

You must first choose the **Business function** you are assigning the incident to. The business function selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the business functions your organisation has created.

After this you must enter the `Title` you want to give the incident, followed by a `Description` of the event. `Method of notification` is how you were made aware of the incident, this could be an email that was sent to your department.

>“Hello Stanley! I am relaying to you the description of an incident that occurred at our work place today. This may be worth entering into our Incident Management System. Hopefully you receive this!
-	Employee 427 via AOL Messenger”

Finally you enter a description of the `Affected service` and assign the incident a `Priority` level.

An example of the priority levels that could be in place are as follows, these are only examples and may not be the policy your organisation follows.

```
P1 = Priority 1 Escalation
Major System defects and crash. Resolution in 6 hours.

P2 = Priority 2 Escalation
Issues with Logging into accounts. Resolution in 9 hours.

P3 = Priority 3 Escalation
Document issues, help with navigation and use of System. Resolution in 48 hours.

P4 = Priority 4 Escalation
Technical queries and advice. Resolution in 72 hours.
```

**Please note that the** `is organisational` **checkbox only applies to P1 incidents, as they affect the entire system.**
