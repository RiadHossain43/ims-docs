# Adding Tasks

## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Task Manager` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

For more information on making changes to your Task Manager click [here][Task Manager].

### Adding a Task

To begin, ensure you are on the tab named `Add task`, then you must choose the **Business Unit** you are assigning the Task to. The business unit selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the business functions your organisation has created.

After doing so, you must name the `Task` and give it a `Description`. Next, you need to assign the task to a member of staff - this can be left as **Unassigned**.

You must input a due date for the task - this is the deadline of the task.
