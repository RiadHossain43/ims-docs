# Adding Tasks

## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Task Manager` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

For more information on making changes to your Task Manager click [here][Task Manager].

### Adding a Task

To begin, ensure you are on the tab named `Add task`, then you must choose the **Business Unit** you are assigning the Task to. The business unit selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select the business functions your organisation has created.

After doing so, you must name the `Task` and give it a `Description`. Next, you need to assign the task to a member of staff - this can be left as **Unassigned**.

You must input a due date for the task - this is the deadline of the task.

## Managing Tasks

*Please note that* `Partner` *business units can only view Tasks that they have been given access to AND are owned by their business unit.*

For each `Task`, you can either `Modify` or `Delete` them, much like with `Assets`, `Risks` and `Incidents`, however you can also `Assign` a Task to a user either from the `Modify` menu or during the creation of the task itself.

### Modifying a Task

In order to `Amend` a Task, select the pencil icon under the `Actions` field and navigate to the tab named `Amend task`. When finished, to save your changes click on `Update`.

If you wish to mark a task as *completed* click on the `Complete` button instead of `Update`.

When modifying a Task, you may be limited by your level of access.

### Deleting a Task

In order to `Delete` a Task, select the trash can icon under the `Actions` field.

When deleting a task, you will first be asked to confirm you really wish to delete the OFI. Please be warned that deleted Tasks cannot be easily retrieved and due care is required. Ensure to make regular [backups][Backup] **not yet made** to safely store information in case of an accident.
