## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Continual Improvement` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

For more information on making changes to OFIs click [here][OFI].

### OFI

An OFI is an opportunity for improvement - whether this is for the department or a specific employee.

To add an OFI, you must first choose the **Business Unit** you believe has an opportunity to improve. 

*The Business Unit selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the Business Units your organisation has created.*

The next thing to do is give the OFI a `Title` then fill the textbox labelled `Opportunity for improvement` with the description of the opportunity.

After that, decide on whom to assign the OFI to. *This is a drop-down menu that contains the names of Users assigned to the Business Units you selected previously.*

Following this, fill the `Cost` with an estimated cost, if any.

*Please note that* `Partner` *business units can only view OFIs that they have been given access to AND are owned by their business unit.*

For each `OFI`, you can either `Modify` or `Delete` them, much like with `Assets`, `Risks` and `Incidents`, however, you can also `Implement` an OFI from the `Modify` menu.
