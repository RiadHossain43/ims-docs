# Adding OFIs

## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Continual Improvement` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

For more information on making changes to OFIs click [here][OFI].


### OFI

An OFI is an opportunity for improvement - whether this is for the department or a specific employee.

To add an OFI, you must first choose the **Business function** you believe has an opportunity to improve. The business function selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the business functions your organisation has created.

The next thing to do is decide whether to assign a specific person to the OFI - again, this is a drop-down menu that contains the names of users assigned to the business function you selected in the previous option. Only assign an owner if the OFI is targeted to a single individual, otherwise leave this option on "Select".

Following this, fill the textbox labeled `Opportunity for improvement` with the description of the opportunity and other information.
