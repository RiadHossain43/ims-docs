### Adding KPIs

After navigating to the `Add KPI` tab, you must first select whether the KPI will be applied to the Organisation or a specific Business Unit using the `Privacy` selector. Next, if you are applying the KPI to a specific Business Unit, choose the `Business Unit` to which the KPI will be assigned to. 

After that, type the details of the KPI into the textbox labelled `KPI/Objectives`, and once done click on the **Create** button.
