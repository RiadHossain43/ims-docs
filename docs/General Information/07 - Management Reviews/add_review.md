### Creating a Management Review

After navigating to the `Add Review` tab in the `Schedule` section of `Management Review`, you must first give the `Meeting Title` which is the name of the meeting. Next, pick a `date` to schedule the meeting for. Lastly, pick an `Interval` for how often the review should recur.

Click on `Confirm` to add the meeting to the schedule. Note that the system will automatically create multiple management reviews to the schedule depending on your selection for `Interval`.
