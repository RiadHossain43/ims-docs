### Supplier

You must first provide a `Supplier Name`, after which choose the **Business Unit** you are assigning the Supplier to. The business unit selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select the business functions your organisation has created.

After this, you must provide the name of an `Account Manager`, the `Account Number` and an `Email` or another form of contact.

Next, enter the `Service Provision` the supplier provides, as well as the `Contract Start Date`. 

The following are optional data that can be added or [edited in][Supplier Management] at a later date. 

+ Contract End Date
+ Review Date

Once you are done, click `Create` to add the Supplier.
