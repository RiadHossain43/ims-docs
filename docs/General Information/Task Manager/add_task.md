# Adding Tasks

## Getting Started

Get started by navigating to and clicking on the `Task Manager` button on the `Sidebar`, which is on the left-hand side.

For more information on making changes to your Task Manager click [here][Task Manager].

### Adding a Task

To begin, ensure you are on the tab named `Add task`, then you must choose the **Business function** you are assigning the Task to. The business function selector is a drop-down menu, from which you can select from the business functions your organisation has created.

After doing so, you must name the `Task` and give it a `Description`. Next, you need to assign the task to a member of staff - this can be left as **Unassigned** which you will need to pick from the drop-down menu if doing so. After selecting **Unassigned** the box should either remove a previously selected name or remain blank.

You must input a due date for the task - this is the deadline of the task.

### Accepting a Task

When you are assigned a task through the Task Manager, you receive the task in your `Requests` tab.

From here you need to click on the green tick under the **Actions** tab, the popup should ask you to confirm accepting the task and upon confirming it will be moved to the tab “My Tasks”

In this tab you can access the details and, when finished, mark the task as complete
