# Business Function

## Creating a Business Function

Please view the first-time configuration guide [here][First Time Configuration] for information on creating Business Functions.

## Access Type

There are two types of Business Functions.
+ Internal Function
+ Partner Organisation

Internal Functions are effectively departments within the same company - for example when making the HR Department you would pick `Internal Function` as the Access Type as it would be the policy put in place for internal users. 

A Partner Organisation on the other hand is for outside parties that need access to the iMS System. This `Access Type` would limit the features users within that function have the ability to access. Currently, you are able to limit access to the following features

+ Inventory Management
+ Risk Management
+ Incident Management
+ Audits
+ Management Review
+ Calendar
+ Task Manager
+ Document Management
+ Continual Improvement
+ Supplier Management
+ Compliance Toolkit
+ Project Management
