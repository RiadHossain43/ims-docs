# Our IMS - System Dates and Report Intervals

## Setting a System Date

You first need to navigate to `Our IMS` on the `Sidebar` which is on the left-hand side. From here, you need to switch to the tab called `System Dates`.
Here, there are two forms. The first form is for System Dates which requires you to pick a `System Start Date` and a `System End Date`. After selecting your dates click on `Confirm` to save your changes.

System Dates allows you to pick a start and end date that the Dashboard should display and use the data of, this allows you to set goals for your organisation and keep track of your progress throughout the year on the dashboard. Once the date has passed, the data is archived **where?** and a new file is created from which the Dashboard will start off as though a blank sheet.

## Report Intervals

You first need to navigate to `Our IMS` on the `Sidebar` which is on the left-hand side. From here, you need to switch to the tab called `System Dates`.
Here, there are two forms. The second form here is for Report Intervals, which requires you to enter a `Name` and `Email` for the person receiving the report, the `Issue Date` for which day of the month they receive the report and a drop-down menu that allows you to pick from:

+ Monthly
+ Quarterly
+ Half-Yearly
+ Yearly

After selecting from the drop-down menu, click on `Confirm` to update your changes or `Reset` to clear the fields.

Report intervals allow you to pick a day for each period where they will be sent an email containing the dashboard report. 

Below the form, you can see a table with all the information about who receives a report, how often and which day of the month. You can also remove a person from receiving a report by clicking on the trash can icon to the right of the column that displays the day of the month they receive the report.
