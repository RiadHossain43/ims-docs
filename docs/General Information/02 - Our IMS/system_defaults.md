# System Default

## Setting a System Date

You first need to navigate to `Our IMS` on the `Sidebar` which is on the left-hand side. From here, you need to click on the button called `System Defaults`.
Here, there are three tabs. The first tab is for System Dates which requires you to pick a `System Start Date` and a `System End Date`. After selecting your dates click on `Confirm` to save your changes.

System Dates allows you to pick a start and end date that the Dashboard should display and use the data of, this allows you to set goals for your organisation and keep track of your progress throughout the year on the dashboard. Once the date has passed, the data is hidden from the dashboard and will not be shown on it.

## Report Intervals

You first need to navigate to `Our IMS` on the `Sidebar` which is on the left-hand side then click on `System Defaults`. 
From here, you need to switch to the tab called `Report Intervals`.
Report Intervals requires you to enter a `Name` and `Email` for the person receiving the report, the `Issue Date` for which day of the month they receive the report, and a drop-down menu that allows you to pick from:

+ Monthly
+ Quarterly
+ Half-Yearly
+ Yearly

After selecting from the drop-down menu, click on `Confirm` to update your changes or `Reset` to clear the fields.

Report intervals allow you to pick a day for each period where they will be sent an email containing the dashboard report. 

Below the form, you can see a table with all the information about who receives a report, how often, and which day of the month. You can also remove a person from receiving a report by clicking on the trash can icon to the right of the column that displays the day of the month they receive the report.

## Incident Resolution

To make any changes to your incident resolution times, you must first click on `Our IMS` from the `Sidebar` on the left-hand side.

Next, click on the `System Default` button then in the `Incident Resolution` tab to find the form that allows you to make adjustments to the recommended incident resolution times.

From here, you can adjust the number of hours of each incident priority.

| Priority 				| Example 																			|
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Priority 1 Escalation | Major System defects and crash. Resolution in 6 hours. 							|
| Priority 2 Escalation | Issues with Logging into accounts. Resolution in 9 hours. 						|
| Priority 3 Escalation | Document issues, help with navigation and use of System. Resolution in 48 hours.	|
| Priority 4 Escalation | Technical queries and advice. Resolution in 72 hours.								|

The incident resolution time affects the relevant graphs on the Dashboard, as the Dashboard will reflect incidents being handled on time.
