# Business Unit

## Creating a Business Unit

Please view the first time configuration guide [here][First Time Configuration] for information on creating Business Functions.

## Access Type

There are two types of Business Functions.
+ Internal Function
+ External Function

Internal Functions are effectively departments within the same company - for example, when making the HR Department you would pick `Internal Function` as the Access Type as it would be the policy put in place for internal users. 

External Functions on the other hand are for outside parties that need access to the iMS System. 

## Access Policy

`Access Policies` allow you to limit the features users within the Business Unit have the ability to access. Currently, you are able to limit access to the following modules:

+ Inventory Management
+ Risk Management
+ Incident Management
+ Audits
+ Management Review
+ KPI/Objectives
+ Continual Improvement
+ Supplier Management
+ Document Management
+ Task Manager
+ Calendar
+ Project Management

You have the ability to choose between giving the user the following permission for each module:

+ Read
+ Write (Create)
+ Delete
+ Full Access (all of the above)

Please view the [User Information and Accessibility][Info] for more information.
