# License Management

## Organisation Overview

This page shows three tables,

| Licenses Allocated |
| :----------------- |
| This is the number of Licenses allocated to your organisation by iMS. |

| Licenses Assigned |
| :---------------- |
| This is the number of Licenses assigned to various Business Units within your organisation. |

| Remaining Licences |
| :---------------- |
| This is the number of Licenses that are not allocated anywhere. |

## Internal / External

Here, you can view allocated licenses and allocate licenses to the various Business Units within your organisation.

**HOS**, **Basic** and **Auditor** show the three different User Types for which licenses can be allocated.

To allocate or revoke licenses within a Business Unit, simply click on the pencil icon to the right of the Business Unit and navigate to the `Manage Licenses` tab. From here, you can use the form to either Allocate or Revoke licenses within that specific Business Unit.

## Request / Requested

This is where you can request licences - as a HoS these requests would go to the Superadmin, as a Superadmin these requests would go to iMS.

The requested tab allows you to view requests you have made, and as a superuser allows you to see requests made by the HoS users in your organisation. You can accept these requests to directly grant the licences or decline the request otherwise.

You can also request access to certain toolkits for your Business Unit or Organisation depending on user level.
