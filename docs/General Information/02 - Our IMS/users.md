# Users

**WIP**

## Creating a User

To create a user, go to the `Create user` tab and fill in the form. 

User Type:
+ Internal Users have access to the system for as long as they are granted access
+ External Users can have their access automatically expire within 5 days, or have the same access rights as an Internal User.

## Granting Access to Users

In order to grant access to a User after creation, simply assign them to a Business Unit and click the green `key` icon to grant access.

*Note, to add a User to a Business Unit they must verify their email address*

## Deleting a User

To delete a User, you must first revoke their access to the System, remove them from the Business Units they are in then click the trash can icon next to their name in the `Users` tab.
